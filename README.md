# openHytale

**openHytale** is a community-driven reverse engineering and decompilation project for the game **Hytale**.  
Once we get our hands on the game files, we will begin analyzing, documenting, and understanding how Hytale works internally.

## 📌 Project Goal

The purpose of openHytale is simple:

**To decompile, analyze, and document Hytale as soon as we obtain access to the game.**

We aim to understand:
- how the engine functions  
- how assets and data formats are structured  
- how scripts, systems, and internal logic operate  
- what possibilities exist for modding and tooling

## 🧪 Current Status

Hytale is not publicly available yet.  
Until then, this repository serves as a **preparation and planning workspace**.

When the game releases (or becomes accessible), active reverse engineering will begin immediately.

## 🔧 Tools We Expect to Use

Depending on Hytale’s final technology stack, we plan to use tools such as:

- Ghidra / IDA Free  
- Java or C# decompilers  
- Python for tooling and analysis  
- Rust/Go for fast standalone utilities  

These may change once the game is released and we know what we’re dealing with.
